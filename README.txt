WEATHER SLICE

Weather Slice is a recreation of the original Weather STAR 4000 system
as used by The Weather Channel in the 90's. Weather SLICE operates as an
independent, self-contained, self-hosted, retro-television channel simulation.
This includes having the ability to set custom announcers for the weather break 
simulations as provided by The Weather SLICE's WS4000 simulation, setting era themes, 
custom music, commercial breaks, ad-rolls, ad-crawls, emergency notifications, and 
with support for personally owned videos.

Long story short, this is a weather star 4000 recreation inside of Python using
PyGame with extra features available to recreate the feeling of watching an old
television station. 

==F.A.Q==
Q. What does SLICE stand for?

A.    No. Weather SLICE is independently created and owned. TWC (The Weather Channel), IBM, and it's known affiliates are not
