WEATHER SLICE

WeatherSLICE is a recreation of the original Weather STAR 4000 system
as used by The Weather Channel in the 90's. Weather SLICE operates as an
independent, self-contained, self-hosted, retro-television channel simulation.
This includes having the ability to set custom announcers for the weather break 
simulations as provided by The Weather SLICE's WS4000 simulation, setting era themes, 
custom music, commercial breaks, ad-rolls, ad-crawls, emergency notifications, and 
with support for personally owned videos.

Long story short, this is a weather star 4000 recreation inside of Python using
PyGame with extra features available to recreate the feeling of watching an old
television station. Assets for this are NOT included, but the application does support
custom assets so, in essence, if you find it and have it locally available - it will play
it. The only non-locally available content that is required for the proper execution of
this application is access to NOAA's weather data - meaning you need an internet connection
for proper data. It will still work without it - but it won't be as cool since it'll display null
everywhere.

==F.A.Q==
Q. What does SLICE stand for?
A.    SLICE stands for STAR-Like Inspired Channel Emulation. STAR stands for Satellite Transponder Addressable Receiver and was arguably one of the most important and memorable of public-facing, weather-forecasting systems.

Q. Is this affiliated with TWC (The Weather Channel)?
A.    No. WeatherSLICE is independently created and owned. TWC (The Weather Channel), IBM, and its known affiliates are not involved in this project nor are they associated with it in any capacity. This is my personal project.

Q. Does this include the music?
A.    No. Similar to other emulators, WeatherSLICE does not include any proprietary assets (to the best of my knowledge). Everything here has been recreated from scratch. However, this application does provide the ability to provide your own music and, if you source the original music (which is not hard) then it's a matter of drag and drop. 

Q. Does this come with the original announcer voice?
A.    No. Dan Chandler is the original voice of the Weather Star 4000 and, while it may be possible to distribute those clips, I'm hesitant to do so. You can find them though and they will work in the program.

Q. Does this come with TV shows, commercials, or other content?
A.    No. But we do support them! If you'd like you can download some (that you legally own of course) and plug them in. The system does not differentiate. In essence what WeatherSLICE does for content outside the STAR4000 recreation is that it classifies videos as either episodes or commercials and attempts to basically "smart" shuffle them in an effort to mimic television stations of yore (and even modern day perhaps!). 

Q. Is this related to TechKnight's project?
A.    No - however it is heavily inspired by it. Without the absolutely phenomenal undertaking and dedication put forth by THETechKnight, this project would be a fever dream at best.
